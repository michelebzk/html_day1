        <p> 
            Just a scar somewhere down inside of me <br>
            Something I can not repair <br>
            Even though it will always be <br>
            I pretend it isn′t there (this is how I feel) <br>
            I'm trapped in yesterday (just a memory) <br>
            Where the pain is all I know (this is all I know)
        </p>
    </div>

<div class="preChorus">
    <p>
        And I′ll never break away (can't break free) <br>
        'Cause when I′m alone <br>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="chorus">
    <p>
        I′m lost in these memories <br>
        Living behind my own illusion <br>
        Lost all my dignity <br>
        Living inside my own confusion <br>
    </p>

<div id="verse2">
    <p>
        But I'm tired, I will always be afraid <br>
        Of the damage I′ve received <br>
        Broken promises they made <br>
        And how blindly I believed (this is all I know) <br>
    </p>
</div>


<div class="preChorus">
    <p>
        And I′ll never break away (can't break free) <br>

<div id="bridge">
    <p>
        I try to keep this pain inside, but I will never be alright <br>
        I try to keep this pain inside, but I will never be alright <br>
        (I'm lost) I try to keep this pain inside, but I will never be alright <br>
        (I′m lost) I try to keep this pain inside, but I will never be alright <br>
